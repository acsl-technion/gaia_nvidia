// uvm_utils.c
//
// This file contains code that works on all supported operating systems.
//

//
// This formats a GPU UUID, in a UVM-friendly way. That is, nearly the same as
// what nvidia-smi reports.  It will always prefix the UUID with UVM-GPU
// so that we know that we have a real, binary formatted UUID that will
// work in the UVM APIs.
//
// It comes out like this:
//
//     UVM-GPU-d802726c-df8d-a3c3-ec53-48bdec201c27
//
//  This routine will always null-terminate the string for you. This is true
//  even if the buffer was too small!
//
//  Return value is the number of non-null characters written.
//
// Note that if you were to let the NV2080_CTRL_CMD_GPU_GET_GID_INFO command
// return it's default format, which is ascii, not binary, then you would get
// this back:
//
//     GPU-d802726c-df8d-a3c3-ec53-48bdec201c27
//
//  ...which is actually a character string, and won't work for UVM API calls.
//  So it's very important to be able to see the difference.
